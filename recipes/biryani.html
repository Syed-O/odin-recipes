    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef biryani is a majestic culinary masterpiece that unites the richness of slow-cooked meat with the aromatic elegance of long-grain basmati rice, layered in an orchestra of vibrant spices. Each bite delivers a burst of flavor—deep, earthy notes from cumin and coriander, warmth from cinnamon and cloves, and the golden glow of turmeric, all harmonized with the tang of yogurt-marinated beef.
        The beef, simmered to melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, is infused with a masala so rich and complex it tells tales of centuries-old kitchens. The rice, fluffy and fragrant, carries whispers of saffron and rose water, each grain distinct yet perfectly united in the dish. Garnished with fried onions, fresh mint, and coriander, and sometimes a hard-boiled egg, beef biryani is both celebration and comfort—a royal feast layered with history, culture, and irresistible flavor.
        It’s not just food it’s an experience.</p>
