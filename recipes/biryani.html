    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef biryani is a majestic culinary masterpiece that unites the richness of slow-cooked meat with the aromatic elegance of long-grain basmati rice, layered in an orchestra of vibrant spices. Each bite delivers a burst of flavor—deep, earthy notes from cumin and coriander, warmth from cinnamon and cloves, and the golden glow of turmeric, all harmonized with the tang of yogurt-marinated beef.
        The beef, simmered to melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, is infused with a masala so rich and complex it tells tales of centuries-old kitchens. The rice, fluffy and fragrant, carries whispers of saffron and rose water, each grain distinct yet perfectly united in the dish. Garnished with fried onions, fresh mint, and coriander, and sometimes a hard-boiled egg, beef biryani is both celebration and comfort—a royal feast layered with history, culture, and irresistible flavor.
        It’s not just food it’s an experience.</p>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Marinate the beef</li></h3>
        <P>In a large bowl, mix the beef with all marinade ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for at least 
            2 hours (overnight for best flavor).</P>
        <h3><li>Cook the beef</li></h3>
        <p>
            In a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker:
            2 tbsp oil or ghee.
            Add the marinated beef and cook on medium-high for 10-15 minutes until browned and moisture reduces slightly.
            Add 1 cup water, cover, and simmer until beef is tender (about 45–60 min; or pressure cook for 25–30 min).
        </p>
        <h3><li>Prepare the Rice:</li></h3>
        <p>
            Bring water to a boil with whole spices and salt.

Add soaked rice and cook until 70–80% done (still firm).

Drain and set aside.
        </p>
        <h3><li>Avengers assemble (Assemble the Biryani):</li></h3>
        <p>
            In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, add a little oil.

Layer half of the cooked beef with gravy.

Add a layer of rice.

Sprinkle half of mint, coriander, green chilies, saffron milk, rose water, and fried onions (if using).

Repeat with the remaining beef, rice, and toppings.
        </p>
        <h3><li>Final Steam (Dum):</li></h3>
        <p>
            Cover tightly with a lid or seal with foil and a lid.

Place on very low heat for 20–30 minutes (or use a heavy tawa/griddle underneath to prevent burning).

Let it rest for 10 minutes before opening.
